# Task Configuration for VS Code

This document guides you through setting up a task configuration file in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Task configuration files are crucial for automating repetitive tasks such as running scripts or compiling code. By setting up this file, you can streamline your workflow in VS Code.

## Overview

The configuration file you'll create is a JSON file that defines various tasks you can run directly from VS Code. This file is typically named `tasks.json` and resides in the `.vscode` subfolder within your project directory.

Below is a generic template for a task configuration file. Replace placeholders with your specific details to tailor the file to your needs.

## Template

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Run Python Script",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "conda activate <your_environment_name> && python <your_script_name>.py",
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "presentation": {
                "echo": true,
                "reveal": "always",
                "focus": false,
                "panel": "shared",
                "showReuseMessage": true,
                "clear": false
            },
            "problemMatcher": []
        }
    ]
}
```

## Instructions

1. **Name Your Folder**: Create a folder named `.vscode` in your project's root directory.

2. **Create the Task Configuration File**:
   - Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a file named `tasks.json`.
   - Copy the above template into this file.

3. **Customize Your Configuration**:
   - Replace `<your_environment_name>` with the name of your Conda environment.
   - Replace `<your_script_name>` with the name of the Python script you want to run.

4. **Using the Configuration**:
   - After setting up, you can run the task by opening the Command Palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
   - Type `Run Task`, then select `Run Python Script`. This will execute the specified script using the defined Conda environment.

## Purpose

This configuration file is used to execute tasks directly within VS Code, enhancing productivity by automating routine actions. It's particularly useful for development environments where you're frequently running scripts or building code.
